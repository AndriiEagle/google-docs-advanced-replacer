# Technical Value of Advanced Replacer for Google Docs

## Project Overview

Advanced Replacer is an automation tool for Google Docs that enables mass text modifications based on JSON directives. The project solves a specific technical problem: efficiently applying large numbers of text edits in documents.

## Technical Capabilities

### Search and Replace Algorithms
- **EXACT**: Precise search with whitespace normalization
- **FUZZY**: Similarity-based search using Levenshtein distance algorithm
- **AI**: Semantic search through OpenAI API

### Supported Document Elements
- Paragraphs and headings
- Lists (numbered and bulleted)
- Tables
- Nested structures

### Recovery System
- Change history storage via DocumentProperties
- Undo last operation functionality
- Original text backup

## Practical Applications

### Usage Scenario
1. **Preparation**: Large language models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) analyze the document
2. **Generation**: AI creates JSON with hundreds of text improvements
3. **Application**: Advanced Replacer automatically applies all changes

### Automation Benefits
- Reduces editing time from weeks to hours
- Minimizes human errors in mass edits
- Ensures consistent rule application throughout the document
- Enables processing of large documents (books, reports, dissertations)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
```
Code.gs - main processing logic
Sidebar.html - user interface
diff_match_patch - library for change visualization
```

### Algorithm Workflow
1. JSON directives parsing
2. Document elements iteration
3. Search algorithms application
4. Replacements execution with validation
5. History storage for recovery

## Limitations and Scope

### Technical Limitations
- Dependency on Google Apps Script API
- Execution speed limitations (Google quotas)
- OpenAI API setup required for AI mode

### Target Audience
- Technical writers
- Editors of large documents
- Researchers working with extensive texts
